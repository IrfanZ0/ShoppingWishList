Welcome to my Shopping Wish List project.  The purpose of this application was to be a shopping buddy in helping to browse and save gifts for friends and families using user profiles.  It contains all the great tools in Android Studio such as Kotlin, MVVM, Retrofit, Jetpack Compose, and many more.  The browsing feature utilizes Google Maps Api, where all the user has to do is type in the search bar what they want, and the Google Map would populate with places that have that item.  For example, typing pizza would show on Google Maps all the pizza locations within the area.  You would then tap the marker for more information.  I've designed this Android application with simplicity in mind.
